# Pneumonia-Detection-CNN-

## 1. Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify **chest X-ray** into **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**. We will use **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to train our model, as they have been shown to be effective in image classification tasks. Our approach involves training a CNN model from scratch on the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset**.

The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.
